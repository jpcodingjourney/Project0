# TicTacToe

Historians believe the name TicTacToe derived from the sound the pencil made when it hit the slate. The modern game we know as TicTacToe is played on a nine-square grid created by drawing lines to create three horizontal rows and three vertical columns.

My version of TicTacToe is now available at https://jpcodingjourney.github.io/TicTacToe/
